			<h2>Ohana</h2>
			<p>My family is my heart.  I have the cutest golden retriever named Chewy.  He deinitely missed his calling as a dog on the ASPCA commercials.  He definitely know how to use those puppy dog eyes to get what he wants.  I am about to marry my best friend, Walt.  He is one of the most amazing men I have ever met.  And I also have the best parents and sister anyone could ask for. I am truly blessed.</p>

			<h2>My Querky Side</h2>
			<p>Until now my querks have been kept under wraps, but I now have the strength to come out to the world. I am a bit of a gamer.  I love Starcraft.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to play the Heart of the Swarm because I have been putting all my free time into studying.  But as soon as I can, I will be back to help terran defeat the zerg and protoss.  SCV ready!</p>
